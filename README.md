# Hi there!
My name is Charles Averill, I'm currently a student at UTD studying Computer Science and Physics, on track for my Bachelor's and PhD in CS.

Check my profile pins for some of my favorite projects, or you can go to [my homepage](https://charles.systems/) to see writeups of some of my projects. 

## What I'm currently working on

As of November 2022, I have just finished working on [Prettybird](https://github.com/CharlesAverill/prettybird), a functional programming language for font generation. I submitted a paper for this project to PLDI 2023 and am waiting to hear back.

I am preparing to teach a course in practical compiler design next semester to a tentative 50 students, the code and lectures for this course will be public soon.

As of Summer 2022, I am working on [Ocarina of Time: Legendary Edition](https://github.com/CharlesAverill/oot_le), a decompilation hack of OOT intended to add story elements (and whatever else I want) from the OOT manga. It's been tons of fun, and the decomp is still in the early documentation phase, so it's like trekking through a jungle most of the time. 

I'm also planning on revisiting [Purple](https://github.com/CharlesAverill/Purple), I have a few ideas of how to go about it and I'm excited to revisit.

As of April 2022, I am in between a few projects. [YARR](https://github.com/CharlesAverill/yarr) is now a fully-functional (and mostly realtime) raytracing renderer written in CUDA C/C++. This project was incredibly fun, I strongly recommend a rendering project to anyone. I'm studying relativity with the intent to add relativistic rendering to the project, with the end goal of drawing some black holes.

I'm also working on a 3D remake of [atc](https://github.com/vattam/BSDGames/tree/master/atc), a very addicting terminal game I've been playing instead of paying attention in class.

As of October 2021, I am currently working on [Purple](https://github.com/CharlesAverill/Purple), a simple compiled language! I'm learning a lot more about assembly and compiler design, and it's a lot of fun designing your own programming language!
