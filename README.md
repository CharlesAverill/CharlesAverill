# Howdy!
My name is Charles Averill, I'm currently waiting to hear back from graduate Formal Verification programs. I graduated from the Unviersity of Texas at Dallas with a degree in Computer Science and Physics.
<!-- a student at UTD studying Computer Science and Physics, on track for my Bachelor's and PhD in CS. -->

Check my profile pins for some of my favorite projects, or you can go to [my homepage](https://seashell.charles.systems/) to see writeups of some of my projects. 

## What I'm currently working on

As of May 2024, I recently accepted my offer of admission to the Computer Science Ph.D. program at the University of Texas at Dallas, where I will be studying under [Dr. Kevin Hamlen](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~hamlen/). I submitted [VOLPIC](https://github.com/CharlesAverill/volpic.git) to the PLDI 2024 Student Research Competition, which has just been accepted! This summer I will travel to Copenhagen to present the research. Since mid-February, I've been solo traveling through Italy, Croatia, and Greece. I've had a wonderful time exploring these countries, and I'm disappointed that my journey will be finished in only a few more weeks. Keep an eye out for the inevitible blog post I'll be writing about the trip. In my free time, I've been studying formal verification by [continuing to work through](https://github.com/CharlesAverill/Software-Foundations-Checklist) the [Software Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/) series, a project that I also recently joined as a contributor. I've also continued to tinker on a [decompilation hack of Pokemon FireRed](https://github.com/CharlesAverill/pokefirered.git) that I pick up every few years, a very relaxing pastime.

  <summary>February 2024</summary>
  
  > As of February 2024, I recently graduated with my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a minor in Physics! I've also submitted my applications for Formal Verification Ph.D. programs at Carnegie Mellon University, Cornell University, The University of Pennsylvania, The University of Washington, MIT, and Oxford University, still waiting on results from each. For the past month I've worked on a few projects, most notably [VOLPIC](https://github.com/CharlesAverill/volpic.git), a formal verification platform for the Pascal programming language using Coq. I gave [this presentation](https://seashell.charles.systems/writings/volpic.pdf) at the Dallas Hackers Association on my progress. In addition to writing code, I've been preparing for my upcoming trip to the Mediterranean by continuing to study Greek (I'm on month 7) and catch up on Italian. I made [this page](https://seashell.charles.systems/travel/crutch) to keep track of phrases I'd like to remember. I've also started to play Chess again, [add me on Chess.com](https://friend.chess.com/Axt9x)!

  <summary>September 2023</summary>

  > As of September 2023, I recently attended IEEE Quantum Week 2023 on scholarship from the NSF. I'm currently applying for graduate CS programs at schools like CMU, UPenn, UW, and Oxford. I'm continuing my research with [Dr. Kevin Hamlen](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~hamlen/) on bottom-up verification of binary programs. I'm working on [NAME](https://github.com/utdscheld/name), a language-agnostic, modular assembly language emulation pipeline as my senior capstone project, I'm teaching the second iteration of my [Introduction to Compiler Design course](https://seashell.charles.systems/teaching/ICD), and I [started playing Go](https://online-go.com/user/view/1392760). Send me a challenge!

  <summary>July 2023</summary>
  
  > As of July 2023, I recently attended PLDI 2023 and presented my poster for [Prettybird](https://github.com/CharlesAverill/prettybird) at the [Student Research Competition](https://pldi23.sigplan.org/details/pldi-2023-src/9/Prettybird-A-DSL-for-Programmatic-Font-Compilation). I'm interning at NVIDIA on the Linux Graphics Testing team for the second time, and I'm researching with [Dr. Kevin Hamlen](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~hamlen/) on bottom-up verification of binary programs. I'm refining the curriculum for my [Practical Compiler Design course](https://seashell.charles.systems/teaching/PCD) for the Fall 23 semester, and I'm ramping up to apply for graduate school for the 2024-2025 school year.

  <summary>March 2023</summary>

  > As of March 2023, I have just submitted an extended abstract of [Prettybird](https://github.com/CharlesAverill/prettybird) to the PLDI 2023 Student Research Competition. I began teaching my [Practical Compiler Design](https://seashell.charles.systems/teaching/PCD) course this semester, and it's going strong. I'll be presenting a talk on Formal Program Verification at the first Dallas Cyberfest soon.

  <summary>November 2022</summary>
  
  > As of November 2022, I have just finished working on [Prettybird](https://github.com/CharlesAverill/prettybird), a functional programming language for font generation. I submitted a paper for this project to PLDI 2023 and am waiting to hear back.
  > 
  > I am preparing to teach a course in practical compiler design next semester to a tentative 50 students, the code and lectures for this course will be public soon.

  <summary>Summer 2022</summary>
  
  > As of Summer 2022, I am working on [Ocarina of Time: Legendary Edition](https://github.com/CharlesAverill/oot_le), a decompilation hack of OOT intended to add story elements (and whatever else I want) from the OOT manga. It's been tons of fun, and the decomp is still in the early documentation phase, so it's like trekking through a jungle most of the time. <br><br> I'm also planning on revisiting [Purple](https://github.com/CharlesAverill/Purple), I have a few ideas of how to go about it and I'm excited to revisit.

  <summary>April 2022</summary>
  
  > As of April 2022, I am in between a few projects. [YARR](https://github.com/CharlesAverill/yarr) is now a fully-functional (and mostly realtime) raytracing renderer written in CUDA C/C++. This project was incredibly fun, I strongly recommend a rendering project to anyone. I'm studying relativity with the intent to add relativistic rendering to the project, with the end goal of drawing some black holes. <br><br> I'm also working on a 3D remake of [atc](https://github.com/vattam/BSDGames/tree/master/atc), a very addicting terminal game I've been playing instead of paying attention in class.

<details>
  <summary>October 2021</summary>
  
  > As of October 2021, I am currently working on [Purple](https://github.com/CharlesAverill/Purple), a simple compiled language! I'm learning a lot more about assembly and compiler design, and it's a lot of fun designing your own programming language!
