# Hi there!
My name is Charles Averill, I'm currently a student at UTD studying Computer Science and Physics, on track for my Bachelor's and Master's in CS.

Check my profile pins for some of my favorite projects, or you can go to [my homepage](https://charlesaverill.github.io/) to see writeups of some of my projects. 

## What I'm currently working on

As of October 2021, I am currently working on [Purple](https://github.com/CharlesAverill/Purple), a simple compiled language! I'm learning a lot more about assembly and compiler design, and it's a lot of fun designing your own programming language!

## Ask me about

My research! I've been researching at various laboratories and about various topics since 2020, and I always enjoy talking about the projects I worked on. Here's the list of publications I've worked on (more to come) - 
- ‚ÄúConnecting the Brains via Virtual Eyes : Eye-Gaze Directions and Inter-brain Synchrony in VR‚Äù
  - Accepted to CHI 2021, Late Breaking Work
