# Hi there!
My name is Charles Averill, I'm currently a student at UTD studying Computer Science and Physics, on track for my Bachelor's and PhD in CS.

Check my profile pins for some of my favorite projects, or you can go to [my homepage](https://charles.systems/) to see writeups of some of my projects. 

## What I'm currently working on

As of April 2022, I am in between a few projects. [YARR](https://github.com/CharlesAverill/yarr) is now a fully-functional (and mostly realtime) raytracing renderer written in CUDA C/C++. This project was incredibly fun, I strongly recommend a rendering project to anyone. I'm studying relativity with the intent to add relativistic rendering to the project, with the end goal of drawing some black holes.

I'm also working on a 3D remake of [atc](https://github.com/vattam/BSDGames/tree/master/atc), a very addicting terminal game I've been playing instead of paying attention in class.

<!--
As of October 2021, I am currently working on [Purple](https://github.com/CharlesAverill/Purple), a simple compiled language! I'm learning a lot more about assembly and compiler design, and it's a lot of fun designing your own programming language!
